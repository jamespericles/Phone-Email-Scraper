### <a name="Description"></a>Description
This simple Python application uses regular expressions to extract only the emails and phone numbers from whatever text is copied to the user's clipboard and copy them to the clipboard. This tool is handy for scraping large documents the user may need to locate emails and phone numbers within. Simple copy all the text that you are interested in, run the program while the text is on your clipboard, then paste the final product where needed. 

### <a name="Installation"></a>Installation
After downloading the application from this repo, it can be ran within whatever application you prefer to use for python. Within terminal, navigate to the directory the app is in and run `python3 app.py` to run the application.

### <a name="Usage"></a>Usage

This tool is handy for finding important information within a large document that would otherwise take much longer. It is not perfect however, as it prints emails and phone numbers in the order they appear without an indicator of who they might belong to. Logically you can assume that the format of whatever document you are extracting from is the same throughout, but if someone happens to not have a phone number listed or someone else is missing an email, it is impossible to know for certain what each piece of data corresponds to. You can search the extracted data within the document to find its location however, but this application doesn't find that information for you.
